# My Personal Portolio 

Welcome to the slightly more personable website version of my resume!

I decided to make this to test my new-found knowledge of React!
During the process of creating this portfolio I also learned react-bootstrap 
which was a huge time saver in creating the responsive navbar. 

This was a fun little project that helped test my front-end knowledge using React!
